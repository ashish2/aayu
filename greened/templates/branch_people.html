		This is a demonstration of areas at modest levels.
		<br />
		<br />
		In this same manner, these Algorithms can scale and be applied to any Place/Space/Area/Locality/Street/City at larger levels.
		<br />
		<br />
		For eg. If there is a DMart store in Borivali, which has "x" SqMeter area, we can figure out, 
		<br />
		<br />
		What should be the max Number of People who can be inside the Store simutaneously at the same time.
		<br />
		<br />
		Same goes for larger places like Street/Locality/City etc.
