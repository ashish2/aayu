		This is a demonstration of areas at modest levels.
		<br />
		<br />
		In this same manner, these Algorithms can scale and be applied to any Place/Space/Area/Locality/Street/City at larger levels.
		<br />
		<br />
		For eg. If there is a DMart store in Borivali, which has "x" SqMeter area, we can figure out, 
		<br />
		<br />
		What should be the max Number of People who can be inside the Store simutaneously at the same time.
		<br />
		<br />
		Same goes for larger places like Street/Locality/City etc. 
		<br />

		<h3>
			Extra Possible Features that can be added: 
				There can be a lot more things that can be done with this software that we can explain to you
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Instead of Random selection of people, rather Select only those people to come out, who are really In Need.
			</li>
			<li>
				People who have IT or ITES or other such Company/JobType, can be given lower priority than People who work in 
				a company dealing with Manual Labour
			</li>
			<li>
				There can be a request/emergency form, where people can place a request that they really need 
				to come out of house for some important work, and the system can consider those people.
			</li>
		</ul>
