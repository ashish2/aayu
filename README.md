## Descrition 2 ##
Aayu: Project Aayu is an attempt to find a good answer to question.
How to save people's lives, minimize risk, when and if they finally decide to venture out of their homes to earn a livelihood, 
during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

###Probable Solution:### 
It takes a simple geometric/mathematic approach to understand: 1. First, how much is the area available in a city or a place or 
for eg. a company 2. Second, What should be the minimum distance between each person in that area. 
And finds out the Max_Number_of_People that, that particular city/place/area/company can Handle at a period of time. 
And, therefore, Only that Max_Number_of_People can be allowed to come out of their homes and go to Companies/Jobs.
